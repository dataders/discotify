# Discotify
## Auto-curate songs shared in Discord into a Spotify playlist

To use:
1. paste Spotify URL into chat
2. song will be added to a playlist

Relies heavily on 
- https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py, and
- https://github.com/plamere/spotipy

## TO DO
1. host the bot on an Azure VM
2. Get others to authenticate to the bot so Spotify will show *who* added the song
3. Make a channel<->playlist mapping
4. Require that a suggestion be :thumbs-up 'd first before adding?
